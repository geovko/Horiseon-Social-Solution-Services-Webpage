# Horiseon-Social-Solution-Services-Webpage

## Description

This webpage is designed to present the information that Horiseon Social Solution Services intended to portray. I refactored the initial code (including the html and css files) in order to make the code more readable and to consolidate the necessary code. In this way, it would be easier for Horiseon to make revisions to their website. Throughout this process, I came to realize the impact that consolidation and naming conventions can have in making a file much more readable and manageable for the user.
